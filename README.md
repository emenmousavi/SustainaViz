# SustainaViz Academic Portfolio

## Overview
SustainaViz is an academic project focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of global sustainable energy datasets. This work demonstrates proficiency in handling large datasets, applying data cleaning techniques, conducting exploratory data analysis, and producing meaningful visual insights for academic and professional contexts.

### Research Goals
- Investigate trends in global access to electricity.
- Analyze and visualize renewable energy consumption over time.
- Examine statistical relationships between energy access and economic indicators.

### Methodologies
#### Data Cleaning
- Address missing values using statistical imputation (e.g., median for numerical fields).
- Eliminate duplicate and inconsistent data.
- Ensure proper formatting and data type integrity.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns and outliers in energy datasets.
- Perform aggregations to summarize data over time.

#### Visualization Techniques
- Time-series visualizations for longitudinal trends.
- Comparative analysis across geographical and economic groups.

## Key Deliverables
### Example Visualization
Below is a sample graph generated in this project, showcasing the global percentage of the population with access to electricity over time (2000 - 2020):
