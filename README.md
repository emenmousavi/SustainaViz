# Global Sustainable Energy Indicators (2000-2020)

## Data Breakdown
I worked with a detailed dataset that includes several vital metrics, such as:

- Country/Region: This identifies the entity for which the data is reported.
- Access to Electricity (% of Population): This metric tracks the percentage of the population with electricity access.
- Renewable Energy Share in Total Final Energy Consumption (%): It highlights how much of the energy consumption comes from renewable sources.
- Carbon Emissions: I calculated carbon emissions per capita, helping identify trends over time.
- Energy Intensity: I analyzed how much energy is used per unit of economic output.

### My Visualizations & Insights
One of the most interesting trends I uncovered was the global increase in **access to electricity**. By visualizing this metric over time, I observed a marked increase from 2000 to 2020. The graph titled** "Global Access to Electricity Over Time"** clearly showed a sharp upward trajectory, illustrating an expansion of infrastructure and policy efforts. This increase is an exciting indicator of progress, but it also drew my attention to regions where access still lags behind.

In addition to electricity access, I analyzed metrics like **carbon dioxide emissions per capita** and **renewable energy capacity**. The sharp trends and comparisons across countries made it evident that while some nations have made huge strides in renewable energy implementation, others still heavily rely on fossil fuels. This pattern sparked a deeper investigation into energy transitions globally and the challenges that remain.

## Academic Use Cases
Through this project, I developed several key insights and potential use cases:
- **Energy Consumption Prediction:** This analysis could be the basis for forecasting future global energy demands.
- **Carbon Emission Forecasting:** By evaluating emissions trends, I could support forecasting efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.
- **Renewable Energy Investment Strategies:** I can now assess countries with the best potential for renewable energy investments, particularly for sustainable projects.
- **SDG Monitoring:** With the sharp rise in electricity access, this project could track how well the world is progressing toward achieving SDG 7.

### Methodologies
#### Data Cleaning
- I addressed missing values using statistical imputation techniques, such as using the median for numerical fields to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Duplicate and inconsistent data entries were removed to maintain data integrity.
- I ensured that the data was correctly formatted and that data types aligned with the analysis requirements, ensuring smooth processing and accurate results.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- I performed a thorough analysis to identify patterns and outliers within the energy dataset, which provided deeper insights into energy access, carbon emissions, and other key factors.
- By performing aggregations, I was able to summarize data over time, giving a clear view of how indicators such as electricity access and renewable energy capacity evolved from 2000 to 2020.

#### Visualization Techniques
- I created time-series visualizations to highlight the longitudinal trends in energy consumption, carbon emissions, and access to electricity over the years.
- I also conducted comparative analysis, visualizing how different geographical and economic groups compare in terms of energy usage, CO2 emissions, and progress towards SDG 7.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in Python programming.
- Mastery of libraries including pandas, and matplotlib.
- Application of data science workflows to solve real-world problems.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project gave me a comprehensive understanding of the complexities of global energy consumption, sustainable energy initiatives, and the challenges in implementing SDG 7. The visual insights that I generated, particularly regarding electricity access, have the potential to guide future energy policies and infrastructure planning worldwide. Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring the ways in which data can drive sustainable energy solutions.
